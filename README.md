# Multi-Tier Enterprise Network

A multi-tiered enterprise network simulation implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. This project showcases a scalable partial mesh topology across multiple sites with full network functionality using VLANs, OSPF, NAT, ACL, DHCP, DNS, and more.

## üó∫Ô∏è Network Topology: Partial Mesh

The network is designed using a **partial mesh topology** to balance redundancy, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Direct connections between essential sites improve communication efficiency without the complexity of a full mesh.

### üåê Connected Sites:

- **Main Site** ‚Üî Regional Office, Manufacturing Facility, Distribution Center  
- **Regional Office** ‚Üî Main Site, Distribution Center, Remote Site  
- **Manufacturing Facility** ‚Üî Main Site, Distribution Center  
- **Distribution Center** ‚Üî Main Site, Regional Office, Remote Site  
- **Remote Site** ‚Üî Regional Office, Distribution Center  

This design allows robust, efficient communication between critical operational nodes while remaining adaptable for future scaling.
